# Science → Screen

Science → Screen is where behavioral science, motor learning, biomechanics, and habit psychology get translated into filmable actions. These pages are deeper (1000–1400 words each), structured for skimmability, and designed to give you the "why" before you shoot the "what."

## What's Inside

- **[Motor Learning](motor-learning.md)** — How skills stick: blocked vs. random practice, feedback timing, external focus cues
- **[Perceptual Skill](perceptual-skill.md)** — Training reactions, decision-making, and anticipation
- **[Habit & Discipline](habit-discipline.md)** — Systems over motivation: triggers, tiny habits, tracking
- **[Pain & Training](pain-training.md)** — Pain science for movement: when to push, when to stop, non-medical framing
- **[Recovery](recovery.md)** — Sleep, active recovery, nervous system regulation
- **[Motivation & Identity](motivation-identity.md)** — Self-determination theory, identity-based habits, intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation

## How to Use These Pages

### If You're a Producer
Read the "Producer Notes" section of each page. Skip the deep theory if you're in a rush. Focus on:
- How to film the concept
- What to say in voiceover
- Example scripts/hooks

### If You're a Coach
Read the "Mechanism" and "Coaching Notes" sections. Use the progressions (L1/L2/L3) to design your own drills. Reference the "Common Mistakes" sections when troubleshooting technique.

### If You're Science-Curious
Read everything. Check the "References" section for further reading. Use the mechanisms to design your own experiments.

## Core Principle

**Science → Screen** means:
1. Understand the mechanism (why it works)
2. Convert it into a filmable drill (what to show)
3. Give a measurable signal (how viewers track progress)

Every page follows this structure.

## Next Steps

Start with the pillar most relevant to your next video:
- Filming a movement drill? → [Motor Learning](motor-learning.md)
- Teaching defense or sparring? → [Perceptual Skill](perceptual-skill.md)
- Explaining habit-building? → [Habit & Discipline](habit-discipline.md)
- Addressing training pain? → [Pain & Training](pain-training.md)
- Discussing rest days or sleep? → [Recovery](recovery.md)
- Talking about motivation or identity? → [Motivation & Identity](motivation-identity.md)

The science is here. Your job is to make it watchable.
