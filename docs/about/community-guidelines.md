# Community Guidelines

Steady Step System is a lifestyle lab where change happens through small, measurable experiments. Our community is built on respect, accountability, and shared progress. These guidelines ensure everyone can participate safely and productively.

## Core Values

### 1. Anyone Can Do It
We meet people where they are. Beginners are celebrated, not shamed. If something feels too hard, we scale it down (L1). No gatekeeping.

### 2. The System Works; We're Not Special
Focus on systems, not personalities. Share what worked, not why you're exceptional. Humble coach energy.

### 3. Discipline > Motivation
We track actions, not feelings. "I did it" matters more than "I felt motivated." Show up even when motivation is zero.

### 4. Educational, Not Medical
We share experiments and observations, not diagnoses or treatments. If you're dealing with pain, injury, or medical issues, consult a professional.

### 5. Evidence-Informed, Experience-Tested
We explain mechanisms simply, then convert them into filmable actions. Science + experience = credibility.

## What We Encourage

### ✅ DONE Comments
Comment "DONE" after completing a Micro-Mission or experiment. Add your rating (stress 1–10, energy 1–10, etc.). This is how we track community engagement.

Example:

### ✅ Experiment Reports
Share your 3-day or 7-day results. What worked? What didn't? What surprised you?

Example:

### ✅ Questions & Challenges
Ask real questions. Challenge us to test new experiments. Suggest next week's YouTube topic.

Example:

### ✅ Progressions & Level-Ups
Share when you move from L1 → L2 or L2 → L3. Celebrate small wins.

Example:

### ✅ Humble Sharing
Share what worked for you, framed as "this helped me" not "you must do this."

## What We Don't Allow

### ❌ Medical Advice or Diagnosis
Don't diagnose others or yourself in comments. Don't recommend medications or treatments. This is educational content, not medical care.

Instead:
- ✅ "I tried this breathing drill and my stress dropped from 8 to 5."
- ❌ "You have anxiety disorder. Take magnesium."

### ❌ Shame or Gatekeeping
No "that's too easy" or "real athletes do X." Everyone starts somewhere. L1 is valid.

Instead:
- ✅ "I started at L2 and moved to L3 after 2 weeks."
- ❌ "L1 is for lazy people. Real training starts at L3."

### ❌ Violence Culture
Skills Track is about sport, discipline, and skill-building. Not street fighting, not violence promotion. Escape-first mindset. De-escalation before confrontation.

Instead:
- ✅ "I learned distance management so I know when to exit."
- ❌ "I'd knock that guy out in 2 seconds."

### ❌ Spam, Self-Promotion, or Off-Topic Links
No advertising, no unrelated links, no "check out my channel" unless directly relevant to the experiment being discussed.

### ❌ Harassment or Disrespect
No personal attacks, trolling, or inflammatory language. Disagree with ideas, not people.

## Reporting & Moderation

If you see content that violates these guidelines:
1. Report it (platform-specific tools: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
2. Don't engage or argue
3. Let moderators handle it

We review reports weekly and remove content that violates guidelines.

## Skills Track Specific Guidelines

### Sparring & Contact Training
- Always show protective gear if contact is involved
- Emphasize controlled, consensual training
- Frame sparring as "learning to stay calm under pressure" not "learning to hurt people"
- Escape and de-escalation cues are mandatory in self-defense content

### Technique Demonstrations
- Show all three levels (L1, L2, L3) where applicable
- Include common mistakes and how to fix them
- Never demonstrate techniques on unwilling or unprepared partners
- Use clear coaching cues and external focus (e.g., "elbow to target" not "contract tricep")

## Content We Cannot Address

We are **not qualified** to provide guidance on:
- Mental health diagnoses (depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, etc.)
- Eating disorders or body dysmorphia
- Chronic pain or injury rehabilitation
- Supplement or medication recommendations
- Specific medical conditions

If your question involves any of the above, please consult a licensed professional (physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, dietitian).

## Final Note

This community is a lab. We experiment, measure, share, iterate. Respect the process. Respect each other. Show up, do the work, comment DONE.
