## Filming Notes

### Batch Filming Strategy
Film all Micro-Missions for the week in one 2-hour session:
- Same location (home, gym, park)
- Same outfit (continuity)
- Same lighting setup
- Film 3 takes of each (safety)

### Real Youth Problems
Film these separately as they require more setup:
- Show the question submission (screenshot or voiceover)
- Film the 3-day experiment setup
- Plan follow-up content if community shares results

### Weekly YouTube
Block 1 full day for filming + 1 day for editing:
- Day 1: Film intro, rules, baseline data, daily check-ins
- Day 2-7: B-roll during the experiment (daily clips)
- Day 8: Film results section, conclusion, CTA
- Day 9: Edit, add graphics, export
- Day 10: Upload, schedule for Saturday

### Community Posts
Create on Sunday mornings:
- Use YouTube Community tab or Instagram Stories
- Reference previous week's content
- Include clear voting options or open-ended question

## CTA Keyword Strategy

Each keyword is:
- **Short** (1-2 words)
- **Memorable** (related to action)
- **Unique** (no repeats in 30 days)
- **Trackable** (you can count comments)

Example comment tracking:

## Iteration Rules

After 30 days, analyze:

1. **Engagement by pillar:** Which pillar got most DONE comments?
2. **Retention by format:** Which shorts had highest watch %?
3. **Community questions:** What problems came up most in DMs/comments?
4. **Personal capacity:** Which formats felt sustainable vs. draining?

Then adjust Month 2:
- Double down on high-performing pillars
- Test new experiment ideas from community
- Replace low-performing formats
- Maintain weekly YouTube (anchor content)

## Next Steps

1. **Customize this calendar:** Replace experiments with ones relevant to your audience
2. **Batch film Week 1:** Get 7 days of content ready before you post Day 1
3. **Set up tracking:** Spreadsheet or notes app to count DONE comments per keyword
4. **Commit to the cadence:** 30 days minimum to see flywheel effects
5. **Iterate at Day 30:** Review data, adjust Month 2

This calendar is a working machine, not a creative experiment. Run it, measure it, improve it. The system works if you work the system.
# Hook Library

Hooks are pattern interrupts that stop the scroll. Every hook must create a curiosity gap, relatability spike, or micro-tension in the first 0-3 seconds.

This library organizes proven hooks by pillar and COM-B lever (Motivation, Capability, Opportunity, Consistency, Relatedness). Use these as templates, not copy-paste scripts. Adapt language to match your voice and audience.

## Energy / Movement

### Motivation Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**
- "I sit 12+ hours a day for work. How do I even start moving?"
- "I'm too tired after work. How do people find energy to exercise?"
- "Every time I try to work out, I quit after 3 days. What's wrong with me?"

### Capability Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**
- "I've never stepped in a gym. Where do I even start?"
- "I can't do a single push-up. Am I too weak to train?"

### Capability Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**

- "I never try new things because I'm scared to look stupid."
- "What's the easiest way to get braver?"

### Consistency Hooks

## Discipline / Systems

### Motivation Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**
- "I have zero discipline. Can this be fixed?"
- "I always start motivated and quit by day 3. Why?"
- "How do disciplined people stay consistent?"

### Capability Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**

### Opportunity Hooks

- "I've never fought. Can I still learn striking?"
- "How do I know if a martial arts gym is good?"

### Capability Hooks

**Real Community Questions:**
- "What's the first thing I should learn in striking?"
- "How do I throw a punch without hurting myself?"
- "What does a correct stance look like?"

### Consistency Hooks

## Hook Formula Templates

Use these formulas to generate new hooks:

### Problem → Micro-Solution

### Experiment Reveal

### Myth Bust

### Level Ladder

### Before → After (Time-Lapse)

### Permission Hook

## Measurement

Track which hooks perform best:

| Hook Type | Avg. Retention % | DONE Comments | Save Rate |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Problem → Solution | 78% | High | Medium |
| Experiment Reveal | 82% | Medium | High |
| Level Ladder | 71% | High | Low |
| Permission Hook | 75% | Medium | Medium |
| Before → After | 85% | Low | High |

Insight: "Experiment Reveal" and "Before → After" have highest retention but lower immediate action. Use these for YouTube. "Problem → Solution" and "Level Ladder" drive most DONE comments. Use these for Micro-Missions.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

❌ **Hype hooks:** "This will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!"  
✅ **Calm promise:** "This works in 10 seconds."

❌ **Guru positioning:** "I'm special because I did this."  
✅ **System positioning:** "I tested this. The system works."

❌ **Vague curiosity:** "You won't believe what happened next..."  
✅ **Specific curiosity:** "7 days, no phone before bed. Results?"

❌ **Shame-based:** "Stop being lazy. Do this."  
✅ **Empathy-based:** "Too tired to move? Try this first."

## Next Steps

1. Choose 5 hooks from this library
2. Adapt them to your voice and audience
3. Film test videos with each hook
4. Track retention % and DONE comments
5. Keep the winners, replace the losers

Hooks are data, not art. Test, measure, iterate. The best hook is the one that makes people stop scrolling and take action.
