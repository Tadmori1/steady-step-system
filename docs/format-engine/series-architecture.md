# Series Architecture

Series Architecture is how you plan multi-video content that builds on itself. Instead of random posts, you create connected experiments that viewers can follow over weeks or months. This section shows you how to design series, balance pillars, and avoid repetition.

## What Is a Series?

A **series** is 3–8 connected videos exploring one behavior change pillar or skill progression.

### Example Series: Sleep Reset (4 weeks)

| Week | Video Title | Experiment | Keyword |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | "I tested no phone 1 hour before bed for 7 days" | Digital sunset rule | SUNSET |
| 2 | "4-7-8 breathing: 7 days of sleep hacks" | Breathwork before bed | BREATHE |
| 3 | "Same bedtime for 7 days. Energy doubled?" | Consistent sleep schedule | SCHEDULE |
| 4 | "Sleep routine in 5 minutes: final test" | Combined protocol | ROUTINE |

Each video stands alone but references previous experiments. Viewers can join at any point.

## Real Experiment Titles (Ready to Produce)

### Series 1: Morning Reset (Energy/Discipline)

**1. "I woke up at 5 AM for 7 days. Here's what actually happened."**
- **Pillar:** Energy/Movement + Discipline
- **COM-B Lever:** Consistency
- **Experiment:** Wake at 5 AM daily, track sleep hours, energy 1–10, tasks completed
- **Hypothesis:** Early wake = more productive if you go to bed earlier
- **Keyword:** EARLYBIRD
- **Expected Result:** Energy +2–3 points if sleep hours maintained, +4–5 tasks/day

**2. "1-minute morning routine for 14 days: minimum viable habit"**
- **Pillar:** Discipline/Systems
- **COM-B Lever:** Capability
- **Experiment:** 60 seconds: wake, water, 10 breaths, walk to door. Track yes/no completion.
- **Hypothesis:** Minimum routine builds consistency better than ambitious routines
- **Keyword:** ONEMINUTE
- **Expected Result:** >90% completion rate, natural expansion to 2–3 min by week 2

**3. "Morning movement: 5 minutes before phone for 7 days"**
- **Pillar:** Energy/Movement + Focus
- **COM-B Lever:** Opportunity
- **Experiment:** No phone until 5-minute movement done (walk, stretch, shadowbox). Track compliance + morning focus 1–10.
- **Hypothesis:** Movement before screen = better focus, less scroll trap
- **Keyword:** MOVEFIRST
- **Expected Result:** Focus +2 points, reduced morning scroll time

### Series 2: Focus Lab (Attention/Discipline)

**4. "Pomodoro for 7 days: 25 minutes changed how I work"**
- **Pillar:** Focus/Attention + Discipline
- **COM-B Lever:** Capability + Consistency
- **Experiment:** 3 Pomodoros daily (25 min work, 5 min break). Track deep work minutes, tasks completed.
- **Hypothesis:** Structured intervals beat unstructured "try to focus"
- **Keyword:** POMO
- **Expected Result:** +45–60 min deep work daily, +2 tasks completed

**5. "Phone in another room for 3 days: focus experiment"**
- **Pillar:** Focus/Attention
- **COM-B Lever:** Opportunity
- **Experiment:** Work sessions = phone out of sight. Track distraction count, focus quality 1–10.
- **Hypothesis:** Physical distance from phone > willpower
- **Keyword:** PHONEFREE
- **Expected Result:** Distraction count drops 60–80%, focus quality +3 points

### Series 3: Courage Micro-Exposures (Confidence/Behavior Change)

**6. "One uncomfortable thing daily for 7 days: confidence experiment"**
- **Pillar:** Courage/Confidence
- **COM-B Lever:** Motivation + Capability
- **Experiment:** Daily micro-exposure: order something new, ask a question in public, make eye contact +1s, send avoided text. Track courage rating 1–10.
- **Hypothesis:** Behavior reps build confidence faster than affirmations
- **Keyword:** UNCOMFORTABLE
- **Expected Result:** Courage rating +2–4 points, easier exposures by day 5–7

**7. "I held eye contact +1 second for 3 days. Results?"**
- **Pillar:** Courage/Confidence
- **COM-B Lever:** Capability
- **Experiment:** Every conversation: hold eye contact 1 second longer than comfortable. Track yes/no + confidence 1–10.
- **Hypothesis:** Tiny discomfort reps stack fast
- **Keyword:** EYES
- **Expected Result:** Confidence +2 points, eye contact becomes automatic by day 3

### Series 4: Skills Track Foundations (Martial Arts as Sport)

**8. "Learning jab-cross combo in 7 days: striking for beginners"**
- **Pillar:** Skills Track (martial arts as sport)
- **COM-B Lever:** Capability
- **Experiment:** 10 minutes daily practicing jab-cross. Day 1 air, Day 3 mirror, Day 5 bag (if available), Day 7 light partner drill. Track form quality 1–10 (self-rated + coach).
- **Hypothesis:** 7 days of deliberate practice = functional combo
- **Keyword:** COMBO
- **Expected Result:** Form quality 3/10 → 7/10, automatic execution by day 7

## Experiment Matrix (Avoid Repetition)

Use this matrix to ensure variety across pillars and COM-B levers:

| Pillar | COM-B Lever | Experiment Ideas | Keyword Examples |
|--------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Energy/Movement | Motivation | "Too tired to move? 10s reset" | SHAKE, STRETCH |

| Community/Accountability | Relatedness | "Tag someone, train together" | SQUAD |
| Skills Track | Capability | "Jab in air, 10 reps daily" | JAB |
| Skills Track | Consistency | "Footwork drill, 7 days" | FOOTWORK |

## Producer Notes: Planning a Series

### Step 1: Choose a Pillar
Pick one pillar to focus on for 4 weeks (Energy, Focus, Sleep, Courage, Discipline, Skills).

### Step 2: Define the Progression
Start simple (L1), add complexity (L2), then challenge (L3) or combine protocols.

Example progression (Sleep):
- Week 1: One variable (no phone before bed)
- Week 2: Add variable (breathing technique)
- Week 3: Add variable (consistent bedtime)
- Week 4: Combine all three

### Step 3: Identify the COM-B Lever for Each Video
Balance Motivation, Capability, Opportunity, Consistency, Relatedness across the series.

### Step 4: Write Hypotheses
Each experiment needs a testable hypothesis:
- "If I [action], then [measurable result]."
- Example: "If I do Pomodoros daily, then deep work minutes will increase by 30%."

### Step 5: Plan Keywords
Choose short, memorable keywords that relate to the action.

### Step 6: Batch Film Intros
Film all 4 video intros in one session if possible. You can add daily updates as the experiments unfold.

## Content Calendar Integration

Map series to the 30-day calendar:

| Week | Format Mix | Series Focus |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Week 1 | 4 Micro-Missions + 1 RYP + 1 YouTube | Morning Reset (Energy/Discipline) |
| Week 2 | 4 Micro-Missions + 1 RYP + 1 YouTube | Focus Lab (Attention) |
| Week 3 | 4 Micro-Missions + 1 RYP + 1 YouTube | Courage Micro-Exposures |
| Week 4 | 4 Micro-Missions + 1 RYP + 1 YouTube | Skills Track Foundations |

Each week's YouTube video anchors the theme. Micro-Missions reinforce it. Real Youth Problems pull from community questions related to that pillar.

## Measurement

### Series Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Series completion | >60% watch all videos | Viewer commitment |
| Keyword consistency | Same users across weeks | Habit formation |
| Challenge scaling | L1 → L2 → L3 progression | Skill development |
| Community questions | Related RYP submissions increase | Engagement depth |

### Example Tracking

**Series: Morning Reset**
- Video 1 (EARLYBIRD): 201 DONE comments
- Video 2 (ONEMINUTE): 156 DONE comments (78% from EARLYBIRD commenters)
- Video 3 (MOVEFIRST): 143 DONE comments (85% from previous videos)

**Insight:** High carryover = series retention working. People are following the progression.

## Arabic Series Names (Optional)

Add Arabic labels inside collapsible sections on each series page:

??? note "Arabic Series Names (Optional)"
    **Morning Reset:**  
    إعادة ضبط الصباح (I'ādat Dabt al-Ṣabāḥ)
    
    **Focus Lab:**  
    مختبر التركيز (Mukhtabar al-Tarkīz)
    
    **Courage Micro-Exposures:**  
    تمارين الشجاعة الصغيرة (Tamārīn al-Shajā'a al-Ṣaghīra)
    
    **Skills Track Foundations:**  
    أساسيات المسار المهاري (Asāsīyāt al-Masār al-Mihārī)

Keep Arabic short and pan-Arab friendly (no country-specific slang).

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Random Weekly Topics
Don't jump from sleep to courage to movement with no connection. Viewers can't follow a story.

### ✅ Progressive Series
Build one pillar over 3–4 weeks, then move to the next.

### ❌ Overly Complex Experiments
"Track 12 variables for 30 days" = failure. Keep it simple.

### ✅ 1–3 Variables Max
Focus on one behavior, track 2–3 metrics.

### ❌ No Hypothesis
Testing without a hypothesis = no learning.

### ✅ Clear Hypothesis
"If I do X, I expect Y to change by Z%."

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your first series:** Pick a pillar (Energy, Focus, Sleep, Courage, Skills)
2. **Outline 4 videos:** Use the progression model (simple → add complexity → challenge)
3. **Write hypotheses:** What do you expect to happen?
4. **Plan keywords:** Short, memorable, action-related
5. **Film Week 1:** Knock out the first video before launching the series

Series Architecture turns content into a system. Viewers follow your journey, join experiments, and build habits alongside you. This is how you create a community, not just an audience.
