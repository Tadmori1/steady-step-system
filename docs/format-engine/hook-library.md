# Hook Library

Hooks are pattern interrupts that stop the scroll. Every hook must create a curiosity gap, relatability spike, or micro-tension in the first 0-3 seconds.

This library organizes proven hooks by pillar and COM-B lever (Motivation, Capability, Opportunity, Consistency, Relatedness). Use these as templates, not copy-paste scripts. Adapt language to match your voice and audience.
