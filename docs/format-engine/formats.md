# Formats

Steady Step System runs on three repeatable content formats. Each format has a specific job: Micro-Missions drive daily action, Real Youth Problems solve actual community questions, and Weekly YouTube builds deeper engagement through 7-day experiments.

Master these three formats, and you can produce content consistently without creative burnout.

## Format 1: Micro-Missions (10–25s)

### Purpose
Drive immediate action. Make the viewer feel like they can do something *right now*. Comment DONE. Rate their result. Build daily engagement.

### Structure

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| Hook | 0–3s | Pattern interrupt. Relatable problem or curiosity. |
| Context | 3–8s | Why this matters in one sentence. The mechanism. |
| Action | 8–18s | The drill. Specific, filmable, trackable. Show L1 and L2. |
| Signal | 18–22s | "Notice the shift." What changes? Energy? Focus? |
| CTA | 22–25s | "Comment DONE + rate [metric] 1–10." |

### Example Script: SHAKE (Energy/Movement)

**Filming Notes:**
- Film in real workspace (desk, home, car)
- Show yourself doing the action (not just talking about it)
- Use on-screen text for CTA keyword: "DONE"
- Keep camera steady or use slight handheld energy

### Example Script: TIMER (Focus/Attention)

**Filming Notes:**
- Show phone going into another room
- Show timer starting
- Quick montage: typing, writing, focused face
- End with timer finishing

### Producer Notes

**Batch Filming:**
Film 5 Micro-Missions in one session (same location, outfit, lighting). Knock out a full week in 90 minutes.

**Editing:**
- Hard cuts only (no transitions)
- On-screen text for CTA keyword
- Subtle background music (low energy, not distracting)
- Export vertical 9:16 for Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts

**Measurement:**
- Watch retention % (target: >65%)
- DONE comments (target: >50 per short)
- Saves (indicates value)
- Repeat commenters (shows habit formation)

## Format 2: Real Youth Problems (30–60s)

### Purpose
Turn community questions into 3-day experiments. Show you're listening. Give specific, trackable solutions. Build trust.

### Structure

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| Question | 0–5s | Show the real question (screenshot or voiceover). |
| Empathy | 5–10s | "I've been there" or "This is common. Here's why." |
| Experiment | 10–40s | 3-day protocol. Exact steps. What to track. |
| Promise | 40–50s | Small but real. "You'll notice [specific shift]." |
| CTA | 50–60s | "Try this for 3 days. Comment your results." Use keyword. |

### Example Script: PHONEFREE (Focus/Sleep)

**Filming Notes:**
- Show the question (screenshot with username blurred if needed)
- Film yourself placing phone outside bedroom
- Show cheap alarm clock (relatability: "you don't need fancy gear")
- End with reminder: "3 nights. Track yes/no and minutes to sleep."

### Example Script: STANDUP (Energy/Movement)

**Filming Notes:**
- Film at desk (relatable workspace)
- Show timer going off
- Stand up, stretch briefly
- On-screen text: "Every 45 min, stand 60s"

### Producer Notes

**Sourcing Questions:**
- Check YouTube comments weekly
- Review DMs on Instagram/TikTok
- Use contact form submissions
- Ask community: "What should I test next?"

**Editing:**
- Show the question first (builds immediate relatability)
- Use on-screen checklist for experiment steps
- End screen: CTA keyword in bold

**Measurement:**
- Completion rate (how many people report back after 3 days?)
- Results diversity (track how many say "worked" vs. "didn't work" vs. "modified it")
- Repeat participants (same usernames trying multiple experiments)

---

## Format 3: Weekly YouTube (8–15min)

### Purpose
Invite deeper participation. Show the full experimental process: hypothesis, protocol, daily updates, data, conclusion. Build community through shared challenges.

### Structure

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| Hook + Question | 0–0:30 | "I tested [behavior] for 7 days. Here's what happened." |
| Rules | 0:30–2:00 | Exact protocol. What I measured. What I didn't change. |
| Baseline | 2:00–3:00 | Day 0 data. Where I started. Why this matters. |
| Daily Updates | 3:00–10:00 | Day 1–7 clips. Honest commentary. Struggles + wins. |
| Results | 10:00–12:00 | Data reveal. Charts, scales, observations. "Was it worth it?" |
| Community Invite | 12:00–13:30 | "Join the challenge. Comment [keyword]. Vote next week's experiment." |
| Outro | 13:30–15:00 | Subscribe CTA. Link to next video. End screen. |

### Example Outline: EARLYBIRD (7 Days Waking at 5 AM)

**Filming Notes:**
- Film intro and rules on Day 0
- Daily clips: 10–30 seconds each (mornings, check-ins, struggles)
- Film results section on Day 8
- Use screen recording for data reveal (simple spreadsheet or chart)

### Producer Notes

**Pre-Production:**
- Choose experiment (community vote or personal curiosity)
- Define rules clearly (write them down)
- Set baseline metrics (measure before starting)
- Plan daily filming triggers (alarm reminder, end-of-day reflection)

**During Experiment:**
- Film daily clips (even if you fail that day—honesty builds trust)
- Track data consistently (spreadsheet, notes app, or paper)
- Don't change other variables (isolate the behavior)

**Post-Production:**
- Edit daily clips into 3–5 minutes (compress, don't eliminate)
- Create simple data visualization (bar chart, line graph, before/after comparison)
- Add on-screen text for key metrics
- Use chapter markers (YouTube feature) for easy navigation

**Measurement:**
- Watch retention (target: >50% at 5-minute mark)
- Community challenge participation (count keyword comments)
- Voting engagement (poll responses)
- Repeat viewers (how many come back next week?)

## How the Formats Work Together

### Weekly Cadence

| Day | Format | Duration | Goal |
|-----|--------|----------|------|
| Monday | Micro-Mission | 10–25s | Daily engagement |
| Tuesday | Micro-Mission | 10–25s | Daily engagement |
| Wednesday | Real Youth Problem | 30–60s | Solve community question |
| Thursday | Micro-Mission | 10–25s | Daily engagement |
| Friday | Micro-Mission | 10–25s | Daily engagement |
| Saturday | Weekly YouTube | 8–15min | Deep participation |
| Sunday | Community Post | — | Vote/leaderboard/check-in |

### Content Flywheel

1. **Micro-Missions** get people to comment DONE → builds habit of participation
2. **Real Youth Problems** show you listen to community → builds trust
3. **Weekly YouTube** invites them to join full experiments → builds identity ("I'm someone who does challenges")
4. **Community Posts** close the loop → people vote next experiment → new content

This creates sustainable engagement without burning out the creator or audience.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Making Micro-Missions Too Long
Target 10–25s. If it's 40s, split it into two shorts or save it for Real Youth Problems format.

### Mistake 2: Vague Experiments
"Try to sleep better" ≠ experiment. "Phone outside bedroom for 3 nights, track yes/no + minutes to fall asleep" = experiment.

### Mistake 3: No Tracking
Every format needs a measurable signal. DONE comments, 1–10 ratings, yes/no tracking, completion counts. If you can't measure it, redesign the experiment.

### Mistake 4: Too Many Formats
Stick to these three. Don't add "Medium-Length Explainers" or "Behind-the-Scenes Vlogs" until you've run this system for 90 days.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Community Input
If 10 people ask the same question, that's your next Real Youth Problem short. Listen to what they're struggling with.

## Next Steps

1. **Pick one format** and produce 3 pieces this week
2. **Test hooks** from the [Hook Library](hook-library.md)
3. **Use the 3-Level Ladder** for every action drill
4. **Track metrics** (watch %, DONE comments, saves)
5. **Iterate** based on what performs best

The formats are designed to be repeatable. Once you internalize the structure, you can produce without creative blocks. The system works if you work the system.
