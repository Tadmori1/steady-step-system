# 3-Level Ladder

The 3-Level Ladder is a progression system that makes every drill, experiment, or skill scalable. It ensures beginners can start immediately (L1), intermediates can challenge themselves (L2), and advanced participants can push limits (L3).

This system is critical for two reasons: it removes the "this isn't for me" excuse, and it keeps experienced viewers engaged as they progress.

## Structure

Every drill, movement, or experiment has three levels:

- **L1 (Minimum Viable):** The absolute smallest version. Anyone can do this right now, even if they're sedentary, tired, or skeptical.
- **L2 (Standard):** The intended version. What you expect most people to work toward after a week or two of L1.
- **L3 (Challenge):** The stretch version. For those who want to test their limits or compete with themselves.

## Example: Push-Up Progression

| Level | Description | Cue |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| L1 | Wall push-up | "Hands on wall, step back, 5 reps" |
| L2 | Knee push-up | "Knees down, chest to floor, 8 reps" |
| L3 | Full push-up | "Toes and hands, chest to floor, 10 reps" |

Same movement pattern. Three entry points. No one is excluded.

## Example: Focus Experiment

| Level | Description | Cue |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| L1 | 5-minute timer, one task | "Phone in another room, 5 minutes, one task" |
| L2 | 15-minute timer, one task | "Phone off, 15 minutes, zero interruptions" |
| L3 | 25-minute Pomodoro | "Full Pomodoro, then 5-minute break, repeat 3x" |

Same mechanism (focus interval). Three difficulty settings.

## Why It Works

### Removes Barrier to Entry
"I can't do a push-up" becomes "I can do a wall push-up." Once they start, they're in the system.

### Builds Momentum
L1 → L2 feels like leveling up. Viewers comment "I moved from L1 to L2 this week!" This is visible progress.

### Keeps Advanced Viewers Engaged
If someone can already do L2, they see L3 and think "challenge accepted." They don't leave because the content is "too easy."

### Makes Every Drill Filmable at Multiple Levels
You can show all three levels in one video. Viewers self-select based on current ability.

## How to Design Levels

### Step 1: Identify the Core Movement or Behavior
What's the essential action? (e.g., push-up, focus interval, morning routine)

### Step 2: Strip It to the Minimum (L1)
What's the smallest version that still delivers the core benefit?  
Examples:
- Push-up → Wall push-up
- Morning routine → 1-minute routine
- Focus → 5-minute timer

### Step 3: Define the Standard (L2)
What's the intended target after 1–2 weeks of practice?  
Examples:
- Push-up → Knee push-up
- Morning routine → 5-minute routine
- Focus → 15-minute timer

### Step 4: Add a Challenge (L3)
What's the stretch version for advanced participants?  
Examples:
- Push-up → Full push-up, explosive variation, or weighted
- Morning routine → 10-minute routine with journaling
- Focus → 25-minute Pomodoro x 3

## Coaching the Ladder

### In Micro-Missions (10–25s)
Show only L1 and L2.  
"Wall push-up if you're starting. Knee push-up if you're ready. 5 reps. Comment DONE + rate your energy 1–10."

### In Real Youth Problems (30–60s)
Show all three levels in a quick montage.  
"Pick your level: L1 = wall, L2 = knee, L3 = full. Do this every morning for 3 days. Track yes/no. Report back."

### In Weekly YouTube (8–15min)
Dedicate a section (1–2 minutes) to explaining progressions.  
"I started at L1 on day 1. By day 4 I hit L2. By day 7 I tried L3. Here's what changed."

## Producer Notes

### Filming
- Film all three levels in one take if possible (side-by-side or sequential).
- Use on-screen text: "L1 / L2 / L3" so viewers can scrub and find their level.
- Keep each level demo under 5 seconds (especially for shorts).

### Editing
- Use split-screen or quick cuts to show progression.
- Add visual indicators (color-coded borders: green = L1, yellow = L2, red = L3).
- If showing all three levels in a short, spend most time on L1 and L2 (they're the majority).

### Voiceover
Use simple language:
- "Start here if you're new" (L1)
- "Move to this when L1 feels easy" (L2)
- "Try this if you want a challenge" (L3)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Making L1 Too Hard
L1 must be embarrassingly easy. If someone thinks "I can't even do L1," you've failed. Strip it further.

### Mistake 2: Making L3 Unrealistic
L3 should be challenging but achievable within 2–4 weeks of consistent practice. Don't make it a circus trick.

### Mistake 3: Not Showing Progressions Visually
Talking about levels without showing them = confusion. Always film all three levels, even if you only use L1 and L2 in the final cut.

### Mistake 4: Using Confusing Labels
Stick to L1, L2, L3 (or Beginner/Standard/Challenge). Don't invent new terms for every video.

## Example Ladder: Morning Routine

| Level | Description | Duration | Cue |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----|
| L1 | 1-minute routine | 1 min | "Wake up, 10 breaths, glass of water" |
| L2 | 5-minute routine | 5 min | "Wake up, 10 breaths, water, 2-minute stretch" |
| L3 | 10-minute routine | 10 min | "Wake up, 10 breaths, water, 5-minute stretch, 3-minute journal" |

## Example Ladder: Sparring Distance (Skills Track)

| Level | Description | Cue |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| L1 | Static distance | "Partner still, you step in/out, find range" |
| L2 | Slow circling | "Partner circles slowly, you maintain distance" |
| L3 | Live movement | "Partner moves freely, you stay in pocket or exit" |

## Measurement

Track progression in comments:
- "Started L1, moved to L2 after 5 days"
- "L2 felt easy today, trying L3 tomorrow"
- "Stuck at L1 but showed up every day"

All of these are wins. The ladder creates visible progress even if someone never reaches L3.

## Next Steps

Use the 3-Level Ladder in every format:
- [Formats](formats.md): See how to integrate levels into each content type
- [Skills Track](../skills-track/overview.md): Every martial arts drill uses this system
- [Hook Library](hook-library.md): Hooks often mention "3 levels" as a pattern interrupt

The ladder is the backbone of scalability. Master it, and your content works for everyone.
