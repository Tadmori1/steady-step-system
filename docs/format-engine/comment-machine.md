# Comment Machine

The Comment Machine is the engagement system that turns passive viewers into active participants. Every piece of content ends with a clear call to action: Comment DONE. Rate 1–10. Share your result. This isn't vanity metrics—it's data collection and community building.

## Why Comments Matter

### 1. Algorithm Signal
Platforms (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) prioritize content with high engagement. Comments = engagement = more reach.

### 2. Accountability Mechanism
Public commitment increases follow-through. Commenting DONE creates social accountability.

### 3. Data Collection
Comments become your dataset. "Energy before: 3/10, after: 7/10" = measurable impact. Aggregate these, and you have proof the system works.

### 4. Community Identity
Repeat commenters become recognizable. They're not just viewers—they're participants in a shared lab.

## The DONE Comment Structure

### Basic Format

### With Rating (Preferred)

### With Context (Gold Standard)

## CTA Keyword System

Every format uses a **CTA keyword**—a short, memorable word viewers comment to signal completion.

### Examples

| Keyword | Format | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| SHAKE | Micro-Mission | Shake hands for 10 seconds |
| TIMER | Micro-Mission | 5-minute focus timer |
| PHONEFREE | Real Youth Problem | Phone outside bedroom, 3 nights |
| EARLYBIRD | Weekly YouTube | Wake at 5 AM for 7 days |
| JAB | Skills Track | Practice jab in air, 10 reps |

### Why Keywords Work

**Trackability:** You can search comments for "DONE" or "SHAKE" and count participation.

**Simplicity:** One word is easier to remember than "Comment if you completed this."

**Community Language:** Keywords become inside language. "I'm on day 5 of EARLYBIRD" = shared experience.

**Gamification:** Leaderboards based on keyword count ("Who commented the most keywords this month?").

## Engagement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Pin the CTA
Pin a comment with instructions:

### Strategy 2: Reply to Every Comment (First 24 Hours)
In the first 24 hours, reply to as many comments as possible. This signals to the algorithm that the content is driving conversation.

**Example Replies:**
- "💪 Nice work! Day 1 done."
- "That energy jump is real. Keep going."
- "4 → 7 is huge. The system works."

### Strategy 3: Shout Out Repeat Commenters
Weekly or monthly, create a leaderboard:

### Strategy 4: Turn Comments Into Content
If someone shares a great result, feature it:

### Strategy 5: Use Polls for Next Experiments
Sunday community posts:

## Producer Notes

### Filming the CTA
- **On-screen text:** Show the keyword in bold (e.g., "Comment SHAKE")
- **Voiceover:** Say it clearly: "Comment SHAKE plus your energy rating, one to ten."
- **Repetition:** Mention the CTA twice (mid-video reminder + end-screen)

### Editing the CTA
- **End screen card:** Text overlay with keyword and rating scale
- **Example comment:** Show an example on screen: "DONE. Energy 7/10."
- **Visual cue:** Use color or animation to highlight the CTA section

### Tracking Comments

**Manual Method:**
- Weekly spreadsheet: Count keywords per video
- Note repeat usernames (identify core community)
- Track rating distributions (most common energy level, focus level, etc.)

**Automated Method (Future):**
- YouTube Analytics API (export comments)
- Python script to parse and count keywords
- Dashboard showing keyword trends over time

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague CTAs
❌ "Let me know what you think in the comments."  
✅ "Comment SHAKE + your energy rating 1–10."

### Mistake 2: No Pinned Comment
Pinning the CTA makes it the first thing viewers see. Don't skip this.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Comments
If you don't reply, viewers stop commenting. Engagement is a two-way street.

### Mistake 4: Changing Keyword System
Don't invent new formats every week. Stick to DONE + keyword + rating. Consistency = trackability.

### Mistake 5: Not Celebrating Participation
Shout out the people who show up. Leaderboards, video mentions, pinned comments—recognition fuels repetition.

## Example Comment Tracking Sheet

| Date | Video | Keyword | Total Comments | DONE Count | Avg Rating (Before) | Avg Rating (After) | Repeat Users |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------| -------------|
| 2/3 | Shake hands | SHAKE | 287 | 143 | 4.2/10 | 7.1/10 | 47 |
| 2/5 | 5-min timer | TIMER | 198 | 87 | 3.8/10 | 6.9/10 | 38 |
| 2/7 | Phone-free | PHONEFREE | 312 | 124 | 5.1/10 (sleep) | 7.8/10 (sleep) | 52 |
| 2/10 | Wake 5 AM | EARLYBIRD | 476 | 201 | 4.0/10 | 7.3/10 | 89 |

**Insight from data:**  
EARLYBIRD (Weekly YouTube) drove the most engagement. More repeat users. Energy improvement consistent across formats (avg +3 points). Phone-free had highest sleep quality gain.

## Next Steps

1. **Set up tracking:** Create a simple spreadsheet or notes system
2. **Pin CTAs:** Every video gets a pinned comment with clear instructions
3. **Reply daily:** First 24 hours, reply to as many comments as possible
4. **Shout out leaders:** Monthly leaderboard recognizing top participants
5. **Turn data into content:** "Here's what 500 of you reported after trying SHAKE..."

The Comment Machine is how you turn content into a system. It's not about likes or views—it's about measurable participation and community identity.
