# Format Engine

The Format Engine is the production blueprint for Steady Step System. It defines the three core formats (Micro-Missions, Real Youth Problems, Weekly YouTube), progression mechanics (3-Level Ladder), engagement systems (Comment Machine), content planning (Series Architecture), and a library of proven hooks.

Everything here is designed to be filmable, measurable, and repeatable. No motivation speeches. No random posting. Just a system that works.

## What's Inside

- **[Overview](overview.md)** — Philosophy, positioning, and the anatomy of a steady step
- **[3-Level Ladder](3-level-ladder.md)** — L1 / L2 / L3 progression mechanics
- **[Hook Library](hook-library.md)** — Proven hooks organized by pillar and COM-B lever
- **[Formats](formats.md)** — Micro-Missions, Real Youth Problems, Weekly YouTube templates
- **[Comment Machine](comment-machine.md)** — How to turn engagement into data and momentum
- **[Series Architecture](series-architecture.md)** — Multi-video planning and experiment matrices
